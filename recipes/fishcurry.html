            <p>If you're trying to add more fish recipes to your menu, you've got to try this curry!

                It's a mild but flavor-packed curry in which fish is cooked in a coconut milk broth with aromatics and fresh herbs, and served with aromatic basmati rice. A simple and very satisfying meal! 
                
                This recipe is inspired by the south-Indian delicacy called Kerala Fish Curry and comes together easily in under 30 minutes, using the Instant pot or stove.
                
                An added bonus of this recipe is that itâ€™s gluten-free, low-carb, and completely dairy-free. Coconut milk adds a naturally sweet flavor that complements the buttery texture of the fish. 
                
                I typically serve this with coconut rice or brown rice. And on days when hubby and I want to eat a low-carb meal, I pair it with Indian-spiced cauliflower rice.</p>
